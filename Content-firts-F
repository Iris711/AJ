It is said that only God, necromancers, and Master Kelly can breathe life into something lifeless. That's not true; I can do it too. I am an animator.

# About me

My name is Daniela, and I have a peculiar hobby that also serves as my life's calling. I am an animator, compelling inert things to no longer be inert.I instruct the animated characters on what to do. If I want them to sit, lie down, or start running, they will do it. I can even give them wings if that's what you desire.

## „Reguiem pro Prahu“

“Requiem for Prague” is a visual novel pc game developed by the Edit team in Prague, set for release in September 2024. At the same time, it's my first major project where I was in charge of all the graphics.
My task was to handle the entire graphic aspect of the game. I created all 27 characters that appear in the game and over 52 different backgrounds. Additionally, I crafted minor animations and visual effects to infuse the game with the right atmosphere.

The game is based on a detective interactive story that explores the dark side of human nature, presenting players with a series of moral choices, each of which influences not only the course but also the ultimate ending of the game.

## FOD Klokánek

The Children in Need Foundation "Klokánek" This year, along with my classmates, I worked on designing posters for the non-profit organization Klokánek. I collaborated with two more experienced graphic designers to put together the final design proposal because I'm not a graphic designer myself and don't have a deep understanding of graphics.
The posters were displayed in the Prague metro for several months.

## Dobrou noc

Good night. It's a short animated fairy tale that doesn't even last three minutes. It deals with what happens after you tuck your child into bed for the night, turn off the lights, and close the door.
"Imagine being four years old, completely alone in the dark, with your parents far away."
The fairy tale explores the themes of fear, nightmares, and suppressed traumas.
