# Dealing with difficult topics

Hello, my name is Daniela, and like all of you, I study at the College of Creative Communication. I'm studying animation, and just like all of you, I also have to complete mandatory practical experience. It was something I was afraid of from the first year because, before I started at this school, I had never focused on graphics and animation. So I've only been doing animation for a while, and I couldn't imagine being hired for any job or someone be willing to actually pay me for the things I draw.

I felt like I didn't know anything, that the competition was too high, and that it would surely  the reason why I wouldn't graduate on this school.
My fears was unnecessary in the end. At the beginning of this year, I got a new job.

Now I work as an animator at Czech Television in the "ČT D" Department.

This department creates games, competitions, and quizzes for children. The target audience is child from four to twelve years old.
The first project, I worked on, in  this job, was fine. It was a very simple IT quiz that we created in cooperation with Matfyz. Matfyz wanted to test something on the kids, so even though the game looked like a simple quiz, it was actually collecting data on how children make decisions and whether they are able to learn from their mistakes.

The quiz was very simple and based on the series "Data village." My job was to create the visuals and all the animations for this game. The quiz is even dubbed, and it was dubbed by Mr. "Matouš Ruml," whom you may know from the series "Comeback."
The second project I received in my new job, which I am currently working on, is not so simple. And it's certainly not so positive.

One day, my boss came to me and said she has been thinking for a long time about creating a storytelling game that would sensitively introduce the issue of child sexual abuse to ...children. Unfortunately, she never figured out how to approach this topic, so the project never stared. She asked me to reflect on this topic, read something about it, and try to come up with some ideas. The game should primarily target children who are experiencing some form of abuse. It should show them that what is happening to them is definitely not okay. That this problem is exists and can be solved.
Children who do not experience such things in their lives will be gently introduced to the topic of sexual abuse.

And... so I began to think about this idea. Over the past month, I've been intensely attend to this topic. I'm reading various articles and studies. I'm listening podcasts on YouTube where adults talk about their experiences of such things happening to them in childhood. I'm studying materials from various organizations that help abused children. There's a lot of pain and trauma in this topic.

I must admit, I'm completely depressed from this topic. It never occurred to me that being an animator could be so sad, stressful, and depressing.

Maybe someday in the future, you might find yourself having to deal with a topic that you struggle to cope with, and perhaps my experience might help someone. What surprised me the most about it all, is how incredibly common this problem is. According to available studies, one from five girls and one from ten boys encounter some form of sexual abuse. That's terribly high. We can be certain that someone among our close friends, someone from our family or colleagues, someone we know, has a similar experience.

People generally think that children are most in danger from complete strangers. That a child will encounter some evil pervert out there. That harm will come to them outside. We tell children not to talk to strangers, but the most terrifying thing is, that most of this happens at home. The most common offender of such things is someone who, the child knows. It could be a parent, step-parent, sibling, relative, neighbor, teacher, or club leader... The statistics I've come across indicate that this accounts for 80% of cases.

Another sad fact that surprised me is that about 69% of men and 79% of women never confide in anyone about it. And the reasons are various. Shame, fear of the aggressor, fear that no one will believe them, trying not to hurt the family, threats...etc.

When I started talking about my current projects with my family and friends, suddenly a few people, whom I've known for a long time and whom I would never have guessed, confided in me that they had gone through something similar themselves. Yet I would have never known. It would have never even crossed my mind.
And the more I know about this topic, the more depressed I become. It upsets me, makes me sad, and I'm sorry about it. 

# How to deal with it, when you have to work on a similar topic?

## 1.) Firstly, realize that you don't have to. 
It's entirely your decision, and no one could blame you for saying you don't want to do it. Try to identify why you got into it and why you started. For me, the reason was simple. I think this topic is incredibly important. And it's important to talk about it and try to communicate it. And since I believe this project could help someone if done well and in cooperation with experts. That's what keeps me going. That's why I'm doing it.

## 2.) Accept things as they are 
When I started delving into this topic and realized what things can happen to children and how common it is, it greatly affected me. It disrupted my sense of normality and safety. Of course, I knew that there were some children who were abused, but I always thought they were isolated cases and that it happened far away. It never occurred to me that it could involve my friends, my relatives, my colleagues.
The only way to deal with it is to accept the fact that you were mistaken. That things are not as you thought. World is not pink. However, this doesn't change your life at the moment, and all you need to be able to accept the new reality... is time.

## 3.) You can´t fix it
It's important to realize that even if you're currently addressing a serious issue and working on a beneficial project, you'll never have the power to solve this problem. Bad things will continue to happen regardless of what you do. It's not within your capabilities to stop it. The only thing you can do is try to help someone. Talk about the problem and communicate it. You can't help everyone, but perhaps you can help an individual person. If even just one person is helped by your project, it's worth it. It may sound like a cliché, but it's true.

## 4.) Talk to others
When you're dealing with a challenging topic, it's good to talk about it with other people so you're not alone. Speaking with others can help you organize your thoughts and alleviate the burden you feel.

## 5.) Positive incentive are important
If you consume a large amount of negative content and do it all day for a long time, it will inevitably have a negative impact on your mood. In this case, it's more important than ever to monitor the content you consume. It's useful to say to yourself, for example, "Right now, I need to consume some positive content," and even if you're not in the mood for it, watch a cheerful series or a fairy tale. For some people might be therapeutic see videos of animals or comedy movies. However, negative things should never be the only thing you see all day, as it will affect you.
