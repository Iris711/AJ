I don't like the word "gymnázium" because it doesn't have a good equivalent in English language. It's hard to translate this word correctly.
In the Czech Republic, when a students finishes primary school and wants to continue studying, they have several types of schools to choose from. The first type of schools are apprenticeships and vocational courses. These schools are easy and usually focus on some type of craft. Studies are usually three years long, and it doesn't end with a matriculation exam.
The second type of schools a student can choose, are specialized high schools. These schools focus on a specific proffesion, such as industrial, medical, educational, artistic, healthcare, agricultural or hotel management.  The study period at these schools is four years, ending with a matriculation exam. Many students who finish these specialized high schools can directly go to work. 
The last type of high school is a „gymnázium“. This school is comprehensive, general and it is preparation for university. Gymnázium is a selective high school, providing complete secondary education. Studies are usually four years long and concludes with a matriculation exam. Gymnázium are the only type of school that a person can start before finishing primary school. During the first and second stages of primary school, a student can decide to leave and start studying at a gymnázium. Therefore, the duration of studying at this school might be not just four years, but could last six or eight years.

The word gymnázium is important part in the Czech education system. However, finding the exact translation into English is difficult. When looking for a matching word, there's often a lack of accuracy and completeness.
One possible translate for "gymnázium" is the term "grammar school." But, in English-speaking countries, this usually means a school focused on language and literary studies. This translation doesn't cover the variety of subjects that define a gymnázium.
Another option is to use the term "high school," which is commonly used for secondary schools in English-speaking countries. However, this term covers many types of secondary schools and doesn't capture the specific academic meaning connected with a gymnázium.
The problem with translating "gymnázium" into English isn't simple. There's no single word or term that fully includes its wide and complex meaning. This causes difficulties in understanding between people who speak different languages.
Language, words, and their translations help us understand the diversity of cultures and education systems. Attempts to translate "gymnázium" into English show the complexity and richness of individual languages.
In conclusion, the word "gymnázium" represents a unique concept in the Czech education system and isn't easily translatable into English without losing some of its rich meaning. It's important to recognize this language barrier and seek communicative ways. 

However, all these language differences make communication a bit more complicated, especially for someone who doesn't fully command the language, into which similar words are being translated. It's important to be cautious and pay enough attention to translation. It's necessary to try understand to other people and their languages.
