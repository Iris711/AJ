# Intro
Hello,
 
 my name is Daniela and I study animation and visual effects at the University od Creative comunication. Since I'm in my third year, this is the year when I have to create my bachelor's thesis.
My bachelor's thesis has two parts. A theoretical part and a practical part.
In the theoretical part, I analyze the history and development of Czech animation from its beginnings to the present. In the practical part of my bachelor's thesis, I'm making an animated film. The film should be at least three minutes long, but I'm sure mine will be longer. The film is done in a 2D style, and I'm creating it using "Adobe Animate, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, and DaVinci Resolve".

Movie is about war and the story is from accient Japan. 

## Thesis - Theoretical part
History and development of Czech animation

### Topic
I write about various animation techniques and styles. I look at technological progress and new tools for animation creation. One chapter is dedicated to how communism and censorship influenced Czech animation. I explore Czech animation abroad. Finally, I analyze key works of Czech animation in detail.

### Why I choose this topic

The Czech Republic has a great tradition in animation. Many Czech works are highly appreciated abroad, and Czech animation is a heritage, we can be proud of. Through my work, I would like to honour all Czech animators, and at the same time, this topic is a way for me to learn even more about our history.

### Information sources
About Czech animation was written a lot of books and they become my main source of information. Besides books, many programs and independent creators discuss the history of Czech animation. Some information can be found, for example, on YouTube. Czech Television also does great work in this regard, with its own program about Czech animators.



## Thesis - Practical part

### Visual style
The story is placed in ancient Japan during the time of the samurais. Because of this, I heavily drew inspiration for the visual side of the film from traditional Japanese art called Sumi-e. It is a type of painting done with black ink. This style emerged in Japan in the 14th century and it is originaly come from China. Today, Sumi-e style is considered as essence of Japanese aesthetics.

### Story
The story is about war. We follow two groups of samurais who meet in a desolate, lifeless landscape and start fighting each other. Every time when someone is injured, instead of blood, pink sakura leafs burst out of the wound. These vivid pink leafs are the only colourful element in the fmovie. When these leafs fall to the ground, the barren and dead land starts turning green. When more samurais lie on the ground and bleed (more sakura petals are in the air), then more the land comes to life. At the end of the movie, when all participants are dead, we can see a lush landscape full of life. The dead bodies become part of the landscape and decompose. No one will ever know that a war took place there in the past. The story highlights the senselessness of war.

Any war, no matter how big, will be forgotten over time.
