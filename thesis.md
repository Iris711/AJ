Hello, my name is Daniela and I study animation and visual effects at the University od Creative communikaction. Since I'm in my third year, this is the year when I have to create my bachelor's thesis.
My bachelor's thesis has two parts. A theoretical part and a practical part.
In the theoretical part, I analyze the history and development of Czech animation from its beginnings to the present. I write about various animation techniques and styles. I look at technological progress and new tools for animation creation. One chapter is dedicated to how communism and censorship influenced Czech animation. I explore Czech animation abroad. Finally, I analyze key works of Czech animation in detail.

In the practical part of my bachelor's thesis, I'm making an animated film. The film should be at least three minutes long, but I'm sure mine will be longer. The film is done in a 2D style, and I'm creating it using "Adobe Animate, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, and DaVinci Resolve".

Movie is about war and the story is from accient Japan.
