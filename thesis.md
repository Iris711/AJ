# Intro
Hello,
 
 my name is Daniela and I study animation and visual effects at the University od Creative comunication. Since I'm in my third year, this is the year when I have to create my bachelor's thesis.
My bachelor's thesis has two parts. A theoretical part and a practical part.
In the theoretical part, I analyze the history and development of Czech animation from its beginnings to the present and I´m closely analyzing the key works of the most important Czech animators. 

In the practical part of my bachelor's thesis, I'm making a short animated film. The film should be at least three minutes long, but I'm sure it will be a little longer. 
The film is about war, the senselessness of violence, the insignificance of life, and the endless cycle of existence. The story is set in ancient Japan.
## Thesis - Theoretical part

I've chosen a topic: History and development of Czech animation

### Topic
I'm writing about different techniques and styles that exist in animation and that have been used in the past in the Czech Republic.
I look at technological progress and new tools for animation creation, how they've influenced the development of Czech animation. One chapter is dedicated to how communism and censorship influenced Czech animation. Communism was in our country for a long time and had a significant influence on the production of films, series, and animation. Creators received funding for their works, but were subject to strict censorship. There was a lack of freedom of expression, and creative creativity was strongly limited. 

At the End I explore Czech animation at abroad. Finally, I analyze key works of Czech animation in detail.

### Why I choose this topic

The Czech Republic has a great tradition in animation. Many Czech works are highly appreciated at abroad, and Czech animation is a heritage, we can be proud of. Through my work, I would like to honour all Czech animators, and at the same time, this topic is a way for me to learn even more about our history. Animation is my job and also my hobby. So, choosing the topic was clear to me from the very beginning.

### Information sources
About Czech animation was written a lot of books and they become my main source of information. Besides books, many programs and independent creators discuss the history of Czech animation. Some information can be found, for example, on YouTube. Czech Television also does great work in this regard, with its own program about Czech animators. As Czech Republic has a great tradition in puppet animation, most study materials can be found for that. However, it's not difficult to find information about other types of animation either.



## Thesis - Practical part

### Visual style
The story is placed in ancient Japan during the time of the samurais. Because of this, I heavily drew inspiration for the visual side of the film from traditional Japanese art called Sumi-e. It is a type of painting done with black ink. This style emerged in Japan in the 14th century and it is originaly come from China. Today, Sumi-e style is considered as essence of Japanese aesthetics.
Since I use the Sumi-e style, I decided to make the film in a flat animation style, which most look like a  traditional Japanese shadow play. The film is characterized by lack of colour. The environment is done in shades of brown, and the characters are usually black and white. The only colourful element is the pink cherry blossom petals, which poetically symbolize blood in the story.

The film is done in a 2D style, and I'm creating it using "Adobe Animate, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, and DaVinci Resolve". 
### Story
The story is about war. We follow two groups of samurais who meet in a desolate, lifeless landscape and start fighting to each other. Every time when someone is injured, instead of blood, pink sakura leafs burst out of the wound. These vivid pink leafs are the only colourful element in the movie. When these leafs fall to the ground, the barren and dead land starts turning green. When more samurais lie on the ground and bleed (more sakura petals are in the air), then more the land comes to life. At the end of the movie, when all participants are dead, we can see a lush landscape full of life. The dead bodies become part of the landscape and decompose. No one will ever know that a war took place there in the past. The story highlights the senselessness of war.

Any war, no matter how big, will be forgotten over time.
