### *It is said that only God, necromancers, and Master Kelly can breathe life into something lifeless. That's not true; I can do it too. I am an animator.*

# About me
My name is Daniela, and I have a peculiar hobby that also serves as my life's calling. I am an animator, compelling inert things to no longer be inert.I instruct the animated characters on what to do. If I want them to sit, lie down, or start running, they will do it. I can even give them wings if that's what you desire.

# About my work
I primarily focus on 2D animation, although I have some experience with 3D. In my projects, I typically combine various techniques, such as flat and hand-drawn animation. I favour a cute, slightly fairytale style, but I often blend it with a darker, horror atmosphere or a heavier theme.

I enjoy working with heavy themes and negative emotions, as I believe I can portray them in a way that is acceptable for the viewer without being traumatizing.

# About my projects

## „Reguiem pro Prahu“

“Requiem for Prague” is a visual novel pc game developed by the Edit team in Prague, set for release in September 2024. At the same time, it's my first major project where I was in charge of all the graphics.
My task was to handle the entire graphic aspect of the game. I created all 27 characters that appear in the game and over 52 different backgrounds. Additionally, I crafted minor animations and visual effects to infuse the game with the right atmosphere.

The game is based on a detective interactive story that explores the dark side of human nature, presenting players with a series of moral choices, each of which influences not only the course but also the ultimate ending of the game.

## FOD Klokánek

In 2023, I participated in a competition organized by the "Klokánek" Foundation for Endangered Children for their planned poster campaign in the Prague Metro.

The campaign aimed to raise awareness that there are children among us who do not have a good life. Children who are subjected to daily harm or even torture. It also highlighted the existence of non-profit organizations striving to help such children.

I am the author of the winning poster and concept, and for several months, these posters were visible in the Prague Metro.

Translation of the poster text: "Some nightmares don't end with waking up".

## Good night

"Good Night" is a short, student-animated film that I created in 2023. It blends horror aesthetics with the aesthetics of children's fairy tales. The film is crafted using the technique of flat animation and addresses themes such as nightmares, suppressed traumas, domestic violence, helplessness, and the human struggle to cope with certain things.
