# First Impression
Hello, I’m Daniela, an illustrator and animator with a passion for children’s storytelling. I also have some great stories of my own to tell, too.


# RECENT WORKS

## „Reguiem pro Prahu“

“Requiem for Prague” is a visual novel game developed by the Edit team in Prague, set for release in September 2024.
I created all graphics and all character designs for this game over a year of working closely with the art director and project manager from the Edit team.

This project was my first significant commission as an illustrator and animator. I was fortunate to work with such an amazing creative team.

## FOD Klokánek

The Children in Need Foundation "Klokánek" This year, along with my classmates, I worked on designing posters for the non-profit organization Klokánek. I collaborated with two more experienced graphic designers to put together the final design proposal because I'm not a graphic designer myself and don't have a deep understanding of graphics.
The posters were displayed in the Prague metro for several months.

## Dobrou noc

Good night. It's a short animated fairy tale that doesn't even last three minutes. It deals with what happens after you tuck your child into bed for the night, turn off the lights, and close the door.
"Imagine being four years old, completely alone in the dark, with your parents far away."
The fairy tale explores the themes of fear, nightmares, and suppressed traumas.
