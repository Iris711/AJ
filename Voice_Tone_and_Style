Hello, my name is Daniela, and I'm not very good at talking to other people. Some people have the gift that when they speak, the whole room goes silent and everyone listens to them. I certainly don't belong to those people. Sometimes I feel like people don't listen to me, I have trouble grabbing attention, and finishing a thought before someone interrupts me.


It's okay. It's a normal thing that happens to introverts. We prefer writing to people rather than talking to them. Often, we can't sort out our thoughts and speak confusedly. Even though I'm not good at talking to other people, I think I'm pretty good at listening to them. And that's important too.

#VOICE
My voice is soft and unassuming. It's somewhat monotonous, yet it's not usually disagreeable to others. My voice reflects my emotions. When I'm sad, it quivers and falters. When I'm joyful, it becomes more lively.
The most off-putting and unpleasant aspect of my voice is when I try to sing. At that moment, my voice can be disagreeable even to me. Nevertheless, I still enjoy singing, especially in the shower where I can't hear myself.

#TONE
"Listening tone" 
It often happens to me (and I don't know why) that other people come to me and want to talk about their problems and troubles. I've never figured out why, but it has always happened to me, since I remember. Many times it involved complete strangers whom I didn't even know. Nevertheless, they tended to confide in me with their problems.
In such situations, I try to talk with calm, reassuring, and gentle tone. I don't speak much, but when I do, I want my tone to convey interest and support. Sometimes the least we can do for others is to listen to them.

"Authoritative tone"
Sometimes there are situations when I am convinced that I am right about something. Others say that at that moment I speak very authoritatively, and my tone doesn't allow for any objections. I don't know if that's true. I'm just trying to explain clearly and logically why I think the truth is on my side.

"Neutral tone"
When I speak with people whom I don't know well and who aren't part of my close circle, I somewhat switch to voice autopilot. My voice takes on an operational tone. It doesn't contain too many emotions and doesn't fluctuate up or down. Its intonation remains constant.

"Friendly tone"
When I'm among friends and close people, my tone is relaxed. It reflects more emotions and sounds lively and cheerful.
